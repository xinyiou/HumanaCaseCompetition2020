After preprocessing the data provided by Humana, we managed to build an Extreme Gradient Boosting, which reached 0.82 precision and 0.82 recall on test dataset. 
The AUC score of our model is 0.76. Based on this model, we made prediction on holdout data and find out that 15.76% people in the dataset have more than 50% probability
of facing transportation difficulties.
