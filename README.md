# HumanaCaseCompetition2020
This jupyter notebook contains our work for Humana/Mays Healthcare Analytics 2020 Case Competition. 
Our team members are Xinyi Ou, Yuqing Zhao and Kaiming Yu.

Social Determinants of Health, or SDoH, include different conditions in the environments where people live. Moreover, these conditions can bring great effect to our health and life quality. This project will focus on Transportation Issues, a type of SDoH, which can cause difficulties for people who are seeking for medical treatment or supplies. We are also looking for practical solutions to improve their lives

After preprocessing the data provided by Humana, we managed to build an Extreme Gradient Boosting, which reached 0.82 precision and 0.82 recall on test dataset. The AUC score of our model is 0.76. Based on this model, we made prediction on holdout data and find out that 15.76% people in the dataset have more than 50% probability of facing transportation difficulties.
